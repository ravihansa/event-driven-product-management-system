## User Input

I need to create an event driven product management crud system using Node.js React.js Mysql (Prisma), when product is created , deleted and updated events need to be triggered and sent to frontend. So What kind of high level architecture do you prefer for this. Give me your multiple suggestions. And also give me technology wise suggestions as well.

## Copilot Output

Here are a few architectural suggestions for your event-driven product management system.

### Suggestion 1: WebSocket-Based Real-time System

This is a common and effective approach for bidirectional real-time communication. The server can push updates to the client, and the client can send messages back over the same connection.

**High-Level Architecture:**

1.  **Frontend (React.js):** A WebSocket client connects to the backend server upon application load. It listens for events like `PRODUCT_CREATED`, `PRODUCT_UPDATED`, and `PRODUCT_DELETED`. When an event is received, the frontend state (e.g., a list of products) is updated in real-time. Standard HTTP requests are still used for the initial data load and for triggering the CRUD actions.
2.  **Backend (Node.js/Express.js):** An Express server handles the standard REST API for CRUD operations (`/api/products`). A WebSocket server (like Socket.IO) runs alongside it. After a database operation (Create, Update, Delete) is successfully performed via Prisma, the corresponding API controller emits a WebSocket event to all connected clients.
3.  **Database (MySQL with Prisma):** Prisma manages the database connection and queries.

**Technology Suggestions:**

*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, Prisma
*   **Frontend:** React.js, `socket.io-client`
*   **Database:** MySQL

### Suggestion 2: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

SSE is a simpler alternative to WebSockets if you only need one-way communication from the server to the client. It uses standard HTTP and is often easier to implement and scale.

**High-Level Architecture:**

1.  **Frontend (React.js):** The client uses the browser's native `EventSource` API to connect to a specific event endpoint on the server (e.g., `/api/events`). It listens for named events and updates the UI accordingly.
2.  **Backend (Node.js/Express.js):** The backend has the standard REST API for CRUD. It also has a dedicated SSE endpoint. When a client connects to this endpoint, the server keeps the connection open. After a successful database operation, the backend writes an event to the response stream of all connected clients.
3.  **Database (MySQL with Prisma):** No changes from the previous suggestion.

**Technology Suggestions:**

*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Prisma (no extra library is strictly necessary for SSE, but packages like `sse-express` can help manage connections).
*   **Frontend:** React.js (using the native `EventSource` API).
*   **Database:** MySQL

### Suggestion 3: Decoupled System with a Message Broker

This architecture is more robust and scalable, making it suitable for microservices or applications where you want to decouple the API logic from the event notification logic.

**High-Level Architecture:**

1.  **API Service (Node.js):** This service handles the CRUD HTTP requests. Instead of directly sending an event to the client, it publishes a message (e.g., `product.created`) to a message broker like RabbitMQ or Redis.
2.  **Message Broker (RabbitMQ/Redis):** Acts as an intermediary. It receives messages from the API service and routes them to any subscribed services.
3.  **Notification Service (Node.js):** A separate service that subscribes to topics/channels on the message broker. It also manages WebSocket connections with clients. When it receives a message (e.g., `product.created`), it pushes a corresponding WebSocket event to the connected clients.
4.  **Frontend (React.js):** The frontend connects via WebSocket to the Notification Service, not the main API service. Its behavior is otherwise identical to Suggestion 1.

**Technology Suggestions:**

*   **Services:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, Prisma
*   **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ (using `amqplib`) or Redis (using `ioredis` for Pub/Sub).
*   **Frontend:** React.js, `socket.io-client`
*   **Database:** MySQL
